# Gold-Demand-Data
This project analyzes gold demand trends across different countries from 2020 to 2023 using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It includes data processing, statistical analysis, and visualizations to understand global gold demand patterns.
 Operations Performed
ðŸ”¢ NumPy Operations
Statistical Analysis:

Calculate mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of gold demand.

Comparisons & Filtering:

Identify the country with the highest gold demand in 2023.

Find countries where demand is above the mean.

ðŸ“Š Pandas Operations
Data Exploration & Manipulation:

Load the dataset and display the first few rows (df.head()).

Sort countries by average gold demand.

Filter countries with positive year-on-year % change.

Find the top 3 countries with the highest demand growth.

Data Normalization:

Apply Min-Max scaling to normalize demand across years.
